# Chapter 2: Digital Legos

  > Do you like Legos? I loved Legos when I was a kid, and I still love them. I
think everyone loves Legos. They are so much fun (though not so much fun
for moms who have to clean up after kids are done with them). You can build
really cool things by putting Lego pieces together, just like the kid who is
trying to build something in the picture below.

  > Do you have a Lego set? Recall what you can build with the set. I used to
own a very small police Lego set. Even though it was small, it was a complex
set because I had to construct a watch tower using Lego pieces. I had to
understand various shapes and how they can fit together because many pieces
looked almost the same. Have you ever seen twin kids that look almost the
same but are two different people? It is so hard to know which one is which.
It took me weeks to figure out the Lego set. I still have the Lego set in my
basement after all these years.

  > Scratch is just like playing with Lego pieces, it’s just on a computer. You
build something by putting pieces together, making sure you are connecting
the right ones.

## What Are Blocks?

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Blocks are a real-life concept. You might have seen white walls made of
concrete blocks just like in the picture below. They are usually used in highrise buildings. Have you visited any high-rise building? In most countries, a
high-rise building is a very tall building with more than 7 floors!

  > Concrete blocks are similar in concept to red bricks but have different
characteristics. Red bricks are more common in Western countries because
they are great at keeping a house warm. Concrete blocks are bulkier and
much stronger so they are ideal for tall buildings.

### Blocks In Programming

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > In Scratch programming, each piece you put together to create stuff is called
a block. This approach to programming is therefore called block-oriented
programming. You must put the right blocks together to create something
meaningful. Depending on the situation, you must also change the setting of
some or all of the blocks to get the desired results. This book will teach you
the entire process. In short, you will become Bob the Builder who scratches!

## Building Lego

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Let us see how we build something using a Lego set.
</details>

### Things we need

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Let’s create a list of everything we need.
  > 1. A complete Lego set. We won’t be able to fully build the desired construction if parts are missing.
  > 2. A picture of the completed construction. This helps us to know if we have put everything together the right way.
  > 3. The Lego set also comes with instructions and the sequence on how to build using that set. You must follow the instructions in the correct sequence to complete the build.
</details>

### Build

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build using a Lego set.
  > 1. Identify all the different pieces (we also call them bricks) in the Lego set.
  > 2. If there are too many bricks, divide them into several heaps by grouping similar bricks together.
  > 3. Using the instructions, start building in the given sequence. I know skipping a few steps sounds tempting, but do not skip a step. It will make things difficult down the line.
  > 4. Once the construction is built, pose like a king because you truly deserve it, and maybe some pizza!

  > Using Scratch to build stuff is very similar to building things with Lego sets.
In both situations, it is very important to follow the sequence. Here’s some
Gandalf wisdom for you: shortcuts are never good, not in real-life and not
while programming. If you do not know who Gandalf is, well, that needs to
be corrected right away!
