  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Hey kid. Hello, yes, you there. It’s me, Nat again! Let me ask you something.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > What’s the best thing that ever happened to you? Think hard, because it is
important.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Was it the first birthday party you remember? Was it when you made your
first friend? Was it when mommy hugged you and said she loves you more
than anything? Was it your dad telling you the best bed-time story ever?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > It was definitely not your first day at school (if it is, you are very lucky,
believe me). I am sure that you love that moment because it makes you
happy. I can tell you what is the best thing that ever happened to computers.
It was programming. Well, it doesn’t make computers happy (because they
can’t feel anything!), but they made people who work with computers very
happy. So, what is programming?
</details>

## What is Programming?

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Programming is the way humans tell machines what to do (much like how
your mom tells your dad what needs to be done!). They are a group of
instructions that people write and feed into machines, then the machines read
them, understand what needs to be done, perform the required actions, and
output the desired results. A simplified definition is: “giving instructions to a
computer to perform some task.”
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > We also use the word “coding” instead of programming, for the simple
reason that programs are also called codes. It is very common in real-life to
have two, three or more words that mean the same. Many people have
nicknames or alternate names. Do you know if you have one? Time to ask
around!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > If you think about it, everyone does some kind of programming in real life,
either when they are interacting with machines or other people. The purpose
of programming might differ, but they do it even without knowing about it.
Next time you see someone telling another person or machine what to do,
you would know they are a programmer!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > But, if everyone does programming in real-life, why are they not able to
program computers? There is a very simple reason. You need to know the
language of computers. Yes, it’s just like English, which helps you
communicate with everyone else. Computers have their own language and
programmers have to learn it before they can start programming. By the way,
did you know English is the most spoken language by humans in the world?
Do you know which is the second most important language in the world? Go
find out!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > But, there’s a problem. Computers communicate through numbers. It’s what
makes them so much faster than humans. A lot of humans are very bad with
numbers. Have you ever memorized number tables? You must know how
difficult it is to remember them. Decades ago, programmers used to code in
numbers so computers could understand the instructions. But, some smart
people invented programming languages that enabled people to use words
and phrases from human languages to write a program. With time,
improvements were made and programming languages became easier. Today,
we have stuff like Scratch that enables kids like you to program fun things
without much of a problem.

## Why Kids Should Learn Programming?

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > I know you must be wondering why you should read this book and not go
watch a cartoon like Spongebob or Spiderman. Or maybe play a game? Well,
here’s a question for you: is it better to watch a cartoon or build one of your
own? How about creating a game of your own that you can play by your own
rules? Sounds fantastic, doesn’t it? Perhaps you challenge your friends to try
and beat you...how much fun that would be! If you stick with this book, you
will be able to do all of these things and more.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > In the introduction to this book, I have already talked about the topic of why
kids should learn programming. Here’s another serious reason: kids can
explore their creative side without the need for big financial investment or the
need to go somewhere else. Truth be told, kids these days also have a busy
schedule. Taking kids out on school days to somewhere that they can focus
on a new thing isn’t feasible for most kids or their parents.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Most homes have access to computers and the Internet, so they can be
utilized for kids without any new investment. The software is completely
free, so there’s no need to allocate gas money or take time out of your
schedule for pick up and drop off. You could be cooking a meal or catching
up on pending tasks while your kid is learning new things and remaining
within your reach.
</details>

## Why Scratch?

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > With this book, kids will learn to use Scratch, a free programming software
used to complete fun projects. Scratch is designed for kids and offers an
engaging, interactive, visual interface to achieve desired results. Kids do not
write program instructions, they manipulate visual objects so there’s no need
to learn any dedicated programming language. Learning how to use Scratch
in itself is quite a fun and engaging experience.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > It is important to note that Scratch is not the only visual programming
software available. There are advanced options like Tynker that kids can use
to create awesome games. But, it is not free and is better for kids who already
have some basic programming knowledge. Scratch is free and relatively basic
so kids do not have a steep learning curve.
</details>

## Answers To Important Questions

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > I understand that as an adult responsible for a kid, you must have many
questions about the Scratch software. Where do I access the software? Is it
safe for my kid? Can I install it on my cell phone and can I choose when my
kid uses the software? Can a stranger interact with them through the
software? In this section, I will try to give as much information as possible to
answer all such questions.
</details>

### Requirements

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > The following things are needed to learn Scratch and start programming with this book.
  > - This book (very funny, I know!)
  > - Access to a working computer or a mobile device such as smartphone or a tablet
  > - Uninterrupted Internet service (if using the online version of Scratch) with correct parental controls
  > - Stationery like a notebook, along with a pencil, eraser, etc
  > - Adult supervision during installation (and uninstallation)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > This book is written with the assumption that we are working on a desktop
computer using a Windows operating system. But, as listed above, you can
use any other computer system or device.
</details>

### Safety and Security

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > It is your responsibility to implement proper parental controls on the
computer and Internet service so the online experience is safe for your kid. If
you are unfamiliar with parental controls, I advise you to learn about them at
the first chance you get and implement them on all devices that are accessible
to kids. In this book, I have assumed that’s already taken care of before
giving kids access to the computer and Internet.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Scratch software is designed for kids and utmost care has been given by
developers and moderators to keep the software and the related online
community safe and secure for kids. Scratch was developed as a free project
by a team of developers at MIT through collaboration with a Canadian firm.
Over the years, the number of users has grown from a few dozens to
hundreds of thousands worldwide and is still growing every day.
</details>

### Exposure

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > Scratch is available as an online tool as well as an offline downloadable software. I would suggest downloading and installing the software on your computer. It gives you two important advantages:
  > 1. Kids can use the software even when the Internet is out
  > 2. You can deliberately turn off the Internet in the device the kid is using for Scratch so you have the surety they won’t be exposed to questionable material over the Internet even by accident
</details>

<details>
  <summary>English version</summary>

  > If you have more questions, you can always visit the online community of
Scratch and find answers. I am sure you will find answers to every possible
concern you might have. When ready, give your kid the thumbs up to
continue with this book! It’s time for magic!
