# Chapter 3: Start Scratching!

Kid, it is time we have some adventure, action and fun. Do you have
permission to install something on the home computer or the smart device
you usually use? If yes, you should follow the next sections to install and
setup Scratch. If not, you need help from an adult again. Sorry, I know, I
promise this is the last time!

Please make sure to write down the password and place it somewhere safe.
Remember that online account passwords must never be shared with anyone
under any circumstances. Modern browsers have the option to save the login
details, which makes subsequent logins convenient and faster. You can also
benefit from that feature.

An email ID is required in the last step to complete sign up. Most common
email services like Gmail do not allow accounts for anyone younger than 13
years old. However, there are many kids-friendly email services such as
Zillamail that have built-in profanity filters offering a safe email service to
kids. On the flipside, most such services are paid. Alternatively, you can use
your parent's email ID to complete the sign up.

### Offline Application (Preferred)

You do not need to sign up for an account to use the Scratch application on
your own computer. The downside is, you will not be able to share your
projects with others on the Internet. But, this option is better for kids like you
who want to become a master.

If you have a Windows 10 based computer, you can also install the Scratch
application through the Microsoft store. Click on the “Windows” logo in the
bottom left corner of your screen. In the search bar type “Microsoft Store”
and select the first option. In the new application window, you will see the
“Search” option towards the top right-hand corner. Search for “Scratch” and
you will see “Scratch Desktop” as the very first option.

No matter how you installed the application, the Scratch application can be
accessed from the start menu. Please note that sometimes applications on
Windows Store are not readily updated. If you installed Scratch from
Windows Store and it gives a fatal error when you run the application,
uninstall it and download the installer from Scratch website. For easier access
for kids, create a desktop shortcut for the application.

## Take Command, Peter Pan!

Hey kid, Nat’s back with you and good news, no more adults and we are all
set up to have fun! I have to ask you a question. Do you know who Peter Pan
is? Yes? Good job smarty-pants. Well, let me tell you anyways, because I
also have a secret to share.

</details>

Peter Pan is an independent, confident, free-spirited kid who can fly, do
magic stuff, goes on adventures, helps other kids, and stands against evil.
He’s also a bit naughty, which is good, right? He also leads other kids so they
can also be good and have fun. You know what’s the sad part? Everyone
thinks Peter Pan is not real.

But, I know a secret no one else knows and I can’t hold onto it any longer.
Let me spill it out. You, Mr. Smarty-pants, are Peter Pan! Well, I know you
can’t fly, but you can do everything else that Peter Pan could, and some
more! You can use Scratch to make amazing things. Let’s dive in!

### Things-That-Must-Not-Be-Done!

Peter Pan is nearly invincible, but even he must be wary of a few things that can hurt really bad. I am giving you a list of things you must never do when using Scratch or anything on the Internet.
  1. Never share the account password with anyone. This is a golden rule for every account made on the Internet.
  2. Never interact with strangers.
  3. Never share personal details with anyone on the Internet. Personal details include your name, contact information such as phone number and where you live. If you think it is important to share, discuss with an adult in your house so they can decide if it’s really necessary.
  4. Never close Scratch application without saving the project (later I will tell you how to save your progress on Scratch).
  5. Never hide if you experienced something on the Internet that made you uncomfortable. Share with your parents so they can protect you.
  6. We, humans, have our limitations. For example, we can’t fly on our own (because humans do not possess the physical requirements needed to fly). So, what would happen if someone tried to fly without using an airplane? They would fall (yikes) and it would be a very unpleasant sight. Just like humans, every machine and every application has some limits. Scratch is no exception, so, we must be aware of them and not exceed the limitations or things can become wonky.
  7. Never leave the computer unattended and unlocked. Pee breaks are important, but before you leave, save your Scratch project and lock the computer. The last thing you want is your younger siblings making a mess or someone shutting down the computer!
  8. Scratch does not have an UNDO feature, so a good idea is to plan ahead. Never start a project without thinking it through. With practice, you won’t be needing to make a lot of changes.
  9. Never be shy of making mistakes. Mistakes are fun because they are easy to remember and help you learn new things.
  10. And the most important thing, because it is the hardest of all: Never give up! Things (like life in general) can be hard sometimes. You will be stuck, but never accept loss. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again!

### The Concept of Give and Take

Have you ever gone to the mall with your parents or to the grocery store?
You must have noticed how your parents hand out money or swipe their
cards and, in exchange, the shopkeeper lets them keep whatever they
gathered. Everything in the world works like this. You have to give
something to get something.

Programming works on the same principles. You write a code/program that
gives instructions to the computer. The computer processes and you get a
response. In the computer world, what you give to the computer we call
“input” and the response we get is called “output”.

Now, here’s when things can get confusing, so pay attention kiddo: programs
are written for someone else to use them (we call them “users”). The user will
use the program to do some work, in short giving input and getting output.
This is how the entire world of the Internet works. Actually, this is also how
the real world works. For example, talking about cars, they are made by
people working in factories. People buy them and use them to go to work, to
shop, and to have fun, like going to picnics.

### Scratch Basics

#### Start Scratch

Let’s start Scratch. Below are instructions for you on how to start Scratch.
  - Click on the Scratch application icon on the desktop. The icon looks like this: ![scratch-icon](images/scratch-icon.png)
  - Scratch will open up. It will look like this. What an amazing colorful screen! Do not worry if things on this new screen do not make sense to you right now. We are going to explain each section very soon. ![scratch-desktop-home](images/scratch-desktop-home.png)

#### Understanding different sections of Scratch screen

##### Menu Bar

The first thing you will notice is the blue line at the top with a bunch of
options (the bunch of options is called a menu). The blue area is a long and
stretched rectangle (like a bar), hence we call this whole area the menu bar.

![scratch-desktop-menu](images/scratch-desktop-menu.png)

- The first option in the blue menu bar is the logo of Scratch.
- The second option on the menu, represented by the icon of the world, is the “language” used in the Scratch application. You can change the language anytime you want. At the start, it is set to English.

- The third option is named “File”, to be honest due to a lack of a better
name! This is an option you will find in the menus of almost every
application and it contains general but important actions. In Scratch, the
“File” contains the following options (I will explain these options in a
bit).

using any of them in this book. However, I will explain them, just for
your curiosity!

- The fifth option is the “Tutorials” where you will find projects that you
can run to understand different things about Scratch. No need to worry
about them, as you have me and this book!

project. It might already be filled with “Scratch Project”, but you can
change it to whatever you like.
