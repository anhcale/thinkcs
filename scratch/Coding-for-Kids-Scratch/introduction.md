# Introduction

Hey kiddo, this is your friendly neighborhood Spiderman! No? Yeah, you got
me, I’m actually Nathan. You can call me Nat because I am also friendly (and
a teensy-weensy bit funny). I am going to take you on an exciting adventure
where you’ll have fun and learn new things at the same time. Everyone thinks
Harry Potter is so cool because he can do magic, but let me tell you a secret.
You can do magic too, you just need to learn how to do it. There’s more good
news! You can do it without going to Hogwarts and leaving your friends and
family!

I am going to teach you Scratch. You’ll learn more about what it is later in
this book, but here’s a little secret: I have written this book so, except for a
few parts where you’ll need guidance or assistance from an adult, you can
learn and do cool stuff without anyone’s help! You can even team up with
your friends or challenge them to complete projects in this book. How cool is
that? Cooler than slurpees, in my opinion!

Hey kid, right now, if you are reading this book all by yourself, you might
want to ask an adult to stick around to answer any questions from here on
until we reach Chapter 2. I know it’s not very cool, but we might need their
help installing something on the computer so you can start doing magic! I
promise, they won’t be needed for the whole book and you can hush them
away when we move on to the fun part.

Hey adult, the kid might need your help until he or she reaches chapter 2. So,
hang around and help them learn some amazing stuff! By the way, thanks for
letting your child read this book. If you are still not sure why every kid
should read it and learn coding, let me explain the dilemma.

In today’s world it is really important for kids to identify and hone their
creative side. It will immensely help them when they grow up and look to do
adult things such as finding a job. Our world is changing fast and
professional skills of the past are becoming obsolete every day. Everything is
being automated, everyday management and operational jobs are getting
scarce, and it will be worse when the kids grow up. But, do you know what
machines won’t be able to ever replace? Human creativity. That mind, the
feelings, that heart, and the things that make us human! You might see burger
flipping machines at McDonalds in the coming years, but you won’t be
seeing a machine making the perfect home-cooked meal a mother can cook
up in the kitchen. You know what makes it taste so much better? It’s the
“being human and loved” feeling that meal gives you that makes all the
difference. That’s what will matter in the future, in the era of machines.

You might be wondering why your child has to use a computer to not be like
a computer? I always encourage kids to be surrounded by parents, family and
friends because kids learn the fastest by observation. What they see adults
doing when they are young will shape how they behave when they grow up.
But, unfortunately, our society and lifestyles aren’t affording us all these
things. Kids these days are also spending a lot of time with smart devices, so
why not use that opportunity to have them learn something useful and still
have fun? So yes, it is not the ideal solution, but this is you making the best
of the circumstances. I have written this book so it’s much more enjoyable
with friends, so please do encourage your kid to read this book and do the
projects with their friends. If they ask you if they can do that, even better.

This book is divided into several chapters, each focusing on only one topic.
You should supervise your child through chapter one because they might
need your help in installing the correct software and in rare circumstances,
also need help in getting used to the computer and software. Kids are quick
learners, so I am confident they won’t need you all the time. Chapter two is
all theory and explains one base concept. If you have already supervised
through chapter one, chapter three wouldn’t require your attention as they
should be able to find and install the software themselves. If they still need
help, please make sure they are not left unattended for a long time as that
might make them frustrated and lose interest. Remember, kids have very
small attention spans. Chapter three also has the first project. All subsequent
chapters will have one or more projects that they can do all by themselves or
with friends to make it more fun. The projects cover various fields and you
should keep an eye out for how they reacted to different projects. It might
help you recognize interests, strengths, and weaknesses.

Make sure to read the conclusion together as well. It has pointers for you to
see what your child thought about the book and what to do next. Every kid is
different. Some might find this book amazing, while some might hate it. It is
completely understandable, and the idea of this book is not to be liked
necessarily, but to fuel the creative mind and spark a response.

One last thing I would advise is to have an open mind when interpreting a
child’s response to this book or to anything else. Creativity at such a tender
age can translate into many different yet amazing things in later years. I still
remember when I was so good with paintings, I was really creative,
temperamental and expressive in my early ages. Today, I am a full-time
programmer who loves solving complex problems with fresh creativity. My
oldest son, Kyle, loves to make sand castles. I get excited and nervous about
what that might translate to in the future. It’s fun in its own way, isn’t it?
Let’s teach every kid something that will help them for the rest of their lives.
